# Kafka-Python

Order Processing Application using Kafka producer & consumer and MongoDB authentication in Flask Python. Please make sure to write unit tests using pytest and add mongo and kafka integration tests, add logging, design by interfaces, follow the design patterns & design principles, fetch kafka and mongo details from external configuration file and create a production ready project structure based on DDD principles.

# Design Approach:
1. Interfaces: Define clear contracts (interfaces) for various layers.
2. Design Patterns:
- Repository Pattern for MongoDB operations.
- Observer/Publisher-Subscriber Pattern for Kafka communication.
- Factory Pattern to abstract object creation (e.g., creating Kafka or Mongo clients).
3. SOLID Design Principles:
- Single Responsibility: Each class has one responsibility.
- Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Classes are open for extension, but closed for modification.
- Dependency Inversion: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.
- Interface Segregation: Create interfaces for specific client needs.
- Liskov Substitution: Subtypes should be replaceable without altering functionality.

## Design Patterns in Use
- Factory Pattern: Used to create instances of domain objects.
- Repository Pattern: Used for abstracting mongo database operations.
- Dependency Injection: Used to inject dependencies (e.g., repositories, services) into classes.
- Service Layer Pattern: Encapsulates business logic in services.

## Enterprise-Ready Considerations
- Logging: Implement structured logging for monitoring.
- Error Handling: Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms for Kafka operations.
- Testing: Write unit and integration tests for each layer (mock Kafka, repositories, etc.).
- Scalability: Design for horizontal scalability (e.g., using partitioning in Kafka, stateless services).
- Security: Secure Kafka connections with SSL, implement authentication and authorization.

## Description

By following DDD principles, using appropriate design patterns, and ensuring external configuration management, you can create an enterprise-ready Kafka-based Python application. This approach not only makes the codebase maintainable and scalable but also aligns with best practices for enterprise applications.

Kafka & Mongo Factories:

MongoFactory: Creates MongoDB client for reuse.
KafkaFactory: Creates Kafka producers and consumers based on the configuration file.
Order Class (dataclass):

The Order class now uses dataclass, simplifying data structure creation and improving readability.
Tests:

Pytest is used for unit testing, with fixtures for dependency injection.
Integration tests for both MongoDB and Kafka are included, ensuring the repository and messaging system work as expected.
Integration Tests:

test_mongo.py: Tests saving and retrieving orders from MongoDB.
test_kafka.py: Tests Kafka event publishing without exceptions.

Running Flask in Different Environments
You can use environment variables to specify which environment Flask should run in.

Development
bash
Copy code
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
Testing
You might run tests using a testing environment:

bash
Copy code
export FLASK_ENV=test
pytest
Production
For production, you should use a WSGI server like gunicorn or uWSGI:

bash
Copy code
export FLASK_ENV=production
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 app:app
